By using static you can not rerun the same code for another purpose because that will overwrite the static value.

Strict superset of single-core code.

Programs are a product of their environment and the constraints it imposes.
Rewrites are okay if you were exploring the problem space first.
It is hard to port single threaded to multi threaded, so you should do it at the start.

Read cannot occur while a write
Writes cannot be to the same memory

ArenaPush is not made thread-safe because that would imply that it is a good default
to have multiple threads push onto the same arena.

Codepaths may be split in their conflict and conflict-free parts to enable better cooperation.

Often a two-step "build" & "join" is faster than a multithreaded "build" step.
